What made your assistant “personal” to you?
What made my assistant 'Pal' personal to me was that it was realistic in the sense of the tasks that I was tracking. It also tracked how many days I had before a big exam I have coming up so it felt as it was tied more to my personal deadlines and goals. Also some humor in the output was nice and made it feel human. 

What challenges did you face using this?
The main challenge I faced using 'this' was remebering how the structure of a constructor function specifically with methods worked. I thought it was a little tricky as I kept trying to not break anything in the code specifically with this.task or this.mood

Which method would you improve or expand?
I would want to improve the completeTask() method. I would want to make it more customizable as not all the time do you finish tasks in order so its currently in first in  first our oder but I would want to change it to maybe remove tasks out of order.
